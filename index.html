                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p id="aboutme"> I LOVE VIDEO GAMES! What else do you need to know?... Nah just kidding.
                    I grew up with video games and computers and have been stuck to it till this day.
                    Much of the game I played was games that inspired creativity and brought your sense of style to the game.
                    It was from here that brought this curiosity that I wanted others to feel the same way and that is why I brought myself
                    to create content that shows it doesn't matter the quantity of it but the quality. I want to show others that they don't have to hide what they enjoy
                    only because others are doing it or because they may not draw attention as others do. Feel free to express yourself and show the things you like to do.
